# Collection of C projects from "Algorithms and Programming" course 

## The course dealt with many themes:

### Analysis of algorithms
* Asymptotic analysis and worst case complexity;
* Sorting algorithms: quadratic (selection sort, insertion sort), linear (counting sort) linearithmic (quicksort, heapsort, mergesort) sorting;

### Static and dynamic data structures and their realization in C
* Pointers;
* Static, stack, and dynamic memory allocation;

### Modularity and modular implementation of algorithms and data structures
- The client-interface-implementation model
- Building a C program with multiple sources and header files

### Recursion and recursive programs
* The concept of recursion
* Recursive mathematical functions
* Simple recursive procedures
* Backtrack and implementation of recursion.

### Discrete mathematics
* Sets, relations, functions,
* Graphs and trees

### Algorithmic paradigms
* Divide et impera
* The greedy paradigm
* Dynamic programming and recursion with memorization

### Problem solving
* Analysis and definition strategies of data structures and algorithms
* Search and optimization problems

### Data structures for symbol tables (6 h)
* Binary Search Trees
* Balanced trees (RB-tree)
* B-tree
* Hash tables

### Algorithms on graphs
* visits in depth and breadth
* applications of visits
* minimum paths
* minimum spanning trees
