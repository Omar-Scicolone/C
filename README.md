# Collection of C projects from "Algorithms and Programming" course 

## The course dealt with many themes:

### Analysis of algorithms
* Asymptotic analysis and worst case complexity;
* Sorting algorithms: quadratic (selection sort, insertion sort), linear (counting sort) linearithmic (quicksort, heapsort, mergesort) sorting;
